summary: HTTP request Lego provider.

description: |
  A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charm](https://juju.is/docs/olm/charmed-operators)
  deploying and managing [HTTP request Lego provider](https://go-acme.github.io/lego/dns/httpreq/)
  on Kubernetes. HTTP request Lego provider is a web application implementing the [DNS HTTP request
  provider as defined by ACME](https://go-acme.github.io/lego/dns/httpreq/) to manage DNS records.

  This charm simplifies initial deployment and "day N" operations of the HTTP request Lego
  provider on Kubernetes, enabling the automation of DNS management. It allows for deployment
  on many different Kubernetes platforms, from [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io) to
  [Charmed Kubernetes](https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes) and public cloud Kubernetes offerings.

  As such, the charm makes it easy for those looking to host their own ACME provider, and gives
  them the freedom to deploy on the Kubernetes platform of their choice.

  For DevOps or SRE teams this charm will make operating HTTP request Lego provider simple and
  straightforward through Juju's clean interface. It will allow easy deployment
  into multiple environments for testing of changes, and supports scaling out for
  enterprise deployments.
